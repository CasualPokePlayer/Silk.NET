# Type Resolution

The resolution code lives in Silk.NET.SilkTouch.TypeResolution and is concerned with resolving `UnresolvedTypeReference` to actual `TypeReference`s.

As the individual parts are only loosely connected and aren't generally dependent on each other, we do not document the individual parts here, please check the XML docs of each of the classes.
